# Video Storage Fix

## Problem

The PicArcade application was encountering errors when trying to store video files in Supabase Storage:

```
Error downloading and storing file: {'statusCode': 400, 'error': InvalidRequest, 'message': mime type video/mp4 is not supported}
Failed to store permanent image, keeping original URL
```

## Root Cause

The Supabase storage bucket was created without proper video MIME type support. The bucket configuration only allowed image MIME types, but the application was trying to upload video files (MP4, WebM, etc.).

## Solution

### 1. Updated Storage Service

The `app/services/storage.py` file has been updated with:

- **Better error handling**: Graceful fallback when video uploads fail
- **Improved bucket configuration**: Added support for video MIME types
- **Bucket recreation method**: Ability to recreate bucket with proper configuration

### 2. Supported MIME Types

The storage bucket now supports:

**Images:**
- `image/jpeg`
- `image/png` 
- `image/webp`
- `image/gif`

**Videos:**
- `video/mp4`
- `video/webm`
- `video/mov`
- `video/quicktime`
- `video/avi`

### 3. Error Handling

When video upload fails:
1. The system logs the specific error
2. For MIME type errors, it suggests recreating the bucket
3. Falls back to keeping the original URL
4. Continues processing without breaking the application

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Automatic Fix (Recommended)

Run the provided script to automatically recreate the bucket:

```bash
python fix_video_storage.py
```

### Option 2: Manual Fix

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/storage/buckets
2. Delete the existing `images` bucket
3. Restart your application - it will automatically create a new bucket with video support

### Option 3: Code Changes

The application will now handle video upload failures gracefully:
- Videos that can't be stored will keep their original URLs
- Thumbnails will still be generated from video frames
- The application continues to work normally

## Testing

After applying the fix:

1. Generate a video using any AI model
2. Check the logs for successful video storage
3. Verify that video thumbnails are generated correctly
4. Confirm that the application continues to work for both images and videos

## Monitoring

Watch for these log messages:

- ✅ `Successfully stored video: [URL]` - Video stored successfully
- ✅ `Generated thumbnail: [URL]` - Thumbnail created successfully  
- ⚠️ `Video MIME type not supported by bucket` - Bucket needs recreation
- ⚠️ `Failed to store video file, keeping original URL` - Graceful fallback

## Future Considerations

- Consider implementing video format validation before upload
- Add video compression for large files
- Implement video streaming for better performance
- Add video metadata extraction and storage
